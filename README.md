# CSCI-5410-Serverless-Data-Processing

## Assignments and Topics

1. **[Assignment 1](): **
   - **PART A**:
      - **Thorough Paper Review**: Meticulously examined the paper titled "Mitigating Cold Start Problem in Serverless Computing: A Reinforcement Learning Approach" by P. Vahidinia, B. Farahani, and F. S. Aliee".Focused on understanding the authors' two-layer approach to reducing cold start delays in serverless computing.
      - **Identified Key Issue**: Pinpointed the primary issue addressed in the paper. The paper's main focus is optimizing serverless performance while minimizing memory waste, aiming to overcome the challenges posed by cold start delays.
      - **Detailed Experiment Analysis**: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the experiments conducted by the authors. The evaluation involved the use of an I/O bound function, and the findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the authors' approach in mitigating cold start issues and improving resource utilization.
   - **PART B**:
      - **Implemented AWS S3 Bucket Creation**: Successfully implemented Java code to programmatically create an AWS S3 bucket.
      - **Handled Errors Effectively**: Implemented error handling mechanisms to efficiently manage situations where the specified bucket name already exists, ensuring uninterrupted execution.
      - **Developed File Upload Functionality**: Developed a method to seamlessly upload the 'index.html' file into the S3 bucket, enabling smooth integration between local files and cloud storage.
      - **Ensured Secure AWS Access**: Utilized the ProfileCredentialsProvider to guarantee secure access to AWS services by effectively managing AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
      - **Thoroughly Documented Codebase**: Meticulously documented the codebase and provided references to official AWS SDK documentation, enhancing overall codebase clarity and transparency.
      - **Gained Valuable Experience**: This assignment equipped me with valuable hands-on experience in AWS S3 and Java programming, establishing a robust foundation in serverless computing and cloud storage services.
